1. compile a program with gdb flag
cc -g <file name> -o <executable name>

--> b +N - Puts a breakpoint N lines down from the current line

--> b fn - Puts a breakpoint at the beginning of function "fn"

--> d N - Deletes breakpoint number N

--> info break - list breakpoints

--> r - Runs the program until a breakpoint or error

--> c - Continues running the program until the next breakpoint or error

--> f - Runs until the current function is finished

--> s - Runs the next line of the program

--> s N - Runs the next N lines of the program

--> n - Like s, but it does not step into functions

--> u N - Runs until you get N lines in front of the current line

--> p var - Prints the current value of the variable "var"

--> bt - Prints a stack trace

--> u - Goes up a level in the stack

--> d - Goes down a level in the stack
