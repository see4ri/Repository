SIP - Overview
--> SIP is a signalling protocol used to create, modify, and terminate a multimedia session over the Internet Protocol.

SIP - Network Elements
1. User Agent
--> An endpoint can initiate, modify, or terminate a session.
 a. User Agent Client (UAC) - The entity that sends a request and receives a response.
 b. User Agent Server (UAS) - The entity that receives a request and sends a response.

2. Proxy Server
-->  takes a request from a user agent and forwards it to another user.
 a. Stateless Proxy Server 
 --> It simply forwards the message received. 
 This type of server does not store any information of 
 a call or a transaction.
 b. Stateful Proxy Server
 --> This type of proxy server keeps track of every request 
 and response received and can use it in future if required. 
 It can retransmit the request, if there is no response from the other side in time.

3. Registrar Server
--> The registrar server accepts registration requests from user agents. 

4. Redirect Server
--> The redirect server receives requests and looks up the intended recipient 
of the request in the location database created by the registrar.

5. Location Server
--> The location server provides information about a caller's possible locations
to the redirect and proxy servers.
